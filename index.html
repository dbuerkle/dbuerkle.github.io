<h3>The acquisition of sentence alternations</h3>

<p>My thesis project is on the dative alternation in first language acquisition, and I'm investigating it using eyetracking and elicited production.</p>

<p>In English, we can express events of real or metaphorical transfer in two ways: we can <i>give a coffee to Kate</i>, or we can <i>give Kate a coffee</i>. (Some other verbs that work like that are <i>show</i>, <i>tell</i>, <i>promise</i>, or even <i>deny</i> for some speakers.) It has been shown that adults subconsciously choose between these two possibilities based on the length, animacy, and grammatical number of the verb&#39;s objects (among other features)&mdash;in the above example, people would be more likely to say <i>He gave Kate a coffee </i>because that way, the short and animate object <i>Kate</i> comes before the longer and inanimate <i>a coffee</i>.</p>

<p>Children who are only just learning English use these transfer verbs (especially <i>give</i>!) all the time, yet it is not at all clear how they choose to order the objects. Some research concludes that they use basically the same criteria as adults, while other work suggests that they only attend to the short-before-long rule. At the root of this disagreement is the problem of too little (good) data. I am addressing this problem by recording the speech of children of various ages as they use the verb <i>give</i> with a variety of objects and by presenting them with a combined touchscreen-act-out and eyetracking task to psycholinguistically get at their subconscious expectations when they hear these transfer verbs.</p>

<p>Beyond the obvious contribution to the understanding of this one phenomenon, the results of my research will also provide insights into the interaction of general cognition and linguistic processing, the acquisition of complex gradient phenomena, and the applications of touchscreen computers as attention-measure devices in psychological research in general.</p>
